[PHP](https://www.php.net) - very underappreciated,  server-side scripting language that's been backbone of the web from the beginning. Thanks to rich history combined with modern features (new releases fixed a lot of problems for which it got it's bad reputation - which persists, even today) it's one of best choices to learn as backend developer - lot of job opportunities in legacy projects as well as very quick development of greenfield projects using existing solutions that are battle tested. PHP is known for its simplicity and flexibility, and it is used by millions of websites worldwide.

[ORM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-orm-the-meaning-of-object-relational-mapping-database-tools/) - In software development, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that allows a program to interact with a relational database management system (RDBMS) using an object-oriented paradigm. An ORM library provides a set of classes and methods that map to the tables, rows, and columns of a database, making it possible to interact with the database using provided API. This means that developer can work with objects/classes rather than write raw SQL statements which can greatly enhance development speed and security (ORMs usually have build int input sanitization).

[Laravel](https://laravel.com) -  a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It has rich ecosystem of libraries that allow us to create full stack web apps very efficiently. It strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.

[Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) - is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's [authentication features](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication), including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. In addition, Breeze includes a simple "profile" page where the user may update their name, email address, and password.

[Laravel LiveWire](https://laravel-livewire.com) - is a library that makes it easy to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces using modern front-end JavaScript libraries such as Vue.js or React. It allows developers to create reactive components in PHP and render them on the server, and then automatically update the components in the browser when the underlying data changes. LiveWire uses its own reactivity system and "virtual DOM" (a lightweight in-memory representation of the DOM) to efficiently update the user interface without requiring a full page refresh (AJAX request to rerender components instead of page).

[Laravel Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) - Laravel Inertia is a JavaScript library that allows you to build single-page applications using server-side rendering with Laravel. It allows you to build SPAs in a way that feels like working with traditional server-rendered applications, while still getting the benefits of a SPA.

In Inertia, you define your application's pages as server-side templates, and then you use Inertia to render them on the client side. When you navigate to a new page, Inertia makes an HTTP request to the server to get the new template and data needed to render the page. It then seamlessly updates the page in the client without having to refresh the whole page. This allows you to build applications that feel fast and responsive, without having to worry about the complexity of client-side routing or state management.

[Laravel Tinker](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/artisan#tinker) - allows you to interact with your entire Laravel application on the command line, including your Eloquent models, jobs, events, and more. To enter the Tinker environment, run:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

[Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) - beautifully-designed administration panel for Laravel created by the creators of Laravel, Nova is designed to make you the more productive by allowing you to setup admin panels in minutes. Working with nova we mostly modify php classes and write little to no frontend (unless project requires heavy customization). It allows us to quickly setup form pages where admins can modify objects stored in database or easily add new ones. I recommend [this tutorial]() to get started.
The brief summary of main features can be found below in [Nova](#nova) section.

## Models

Models provide a powerful interface for you to interact with the tables in database. Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies interactions with database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" to interact with that table - in addition to retrieving records from the database table, models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

To create new model faster we can use:

```bash
php artisan make:model <ModelName>
```

To inspect models we can use:
```bash
php artisan model:show <ModelName>
```

We can add **--migration** modifier to migrate model straight away.

By convention, models should be kept in **app/Models** directory and tables created using migration will use **snake_case plural** form of model name.

Each model's corresponding database table has a primary key column named id. If necessary, you may define a protected **$primaryKey** property on your model to specify a different column that serves as your model's primary key. Primary key, by default, is an incrementing integer value, which means that Eloquent will automatically cast the primary key to an integer.

Each model is protected from mass assignment vulnerability because Laravel blocks mass assignment by default. Because they can be useful sometimes you can create **$fillable** field in your model to enable assignment of safe attributes:

```php
protected $fillable = [ 'attribute_name' ];
```

### Updating models

When we write update method in a controller (it receives **$request** and **$model** as arguments) we can first define rules for who can perform changes to db for given model by calling:

```php
$this->authorize('update', $model);
```

This will prevent anyone from updating given model until we define [Authorization Rules](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authorization) in our [Policy](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authorization#creating-policies) for given model.

Then, in the YourModelPolicy.php class we need to define a method that returns a bool:

```php
public function update(User $user, YourModel $model)
{
  return $model->user()->is($user);
}
```

Sometimes you want to hide some fields when returning from API. You can do it by defining **$hidden** property on a model:

```php
protected $hidden = ['password', 'email', 'spouse' ]
```

If you ever want to return a model with it's hidden fields you can do it using **->withHidden()** method.

[Read morea about models ->](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent#introduction)

## Migrations

A version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition. Laravel's Schema facade provides database agnostic support for creating and manipulating tables across all of Laravel's supported database systems. To generate a database migration use:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

*Each database migration will only be run once. To make additional to tables during development (update an un-deployed migration and rebuild your database from scratch) use **php artisan migrate:fresh**)*

or for single model:

```bash
php artisan make:migration <migration_name example: create_flights_table>
```

Laravel will use the name of the migration to attempt to guess the name of the table and whether or not the migration will be creating a new table. If Laravel is able to determine the table name from the migration name, Laravel will pre-fill the generated migration file with the specified table. Otherwise, you may simply specify the table in the migration file manually

Each new migration will be placed in your database/migrations directory. Each migration filename contains a timestamp that allows Laravel to determine the order of the migrations.

## Controllers

Controllers are responsible for processing requests made to your application and returning a response. All of request handling logic can be organized using "controller" classes. Controllers  group related request handling logic into a single class. For example, a UserController class might handle all incoming requests related to users, including showing, creating, updating, and deleting users. By default, controllers are stored in the **app/Http/Controllers** directory. all Controllers extend **App\Http\Controllers\Controller** class included in Laravel.

To create controller use:

```bash
php artisan make:controller <ControllerName>
```

Basic controller's usage:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

Route::get('/user/{is}', [UserController::class, 'show']);
```

### Resource Controllers

Each model in your application can be think of as a "resource" and since it is typical to perform CRUD operations on resources, Laravel resource routing assigns methods for those operations with a single line of code.

Example use:

```bash
php artisan make:controller <YourController> --resource
```

This command will generate a controller at **app/Http/Controllers/PhotoController.php**. The controller will contain a method for each of the available resource operations. Next, you may register a resource route that points to the controller:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PhotoController;

Route::resource('photos', PhotoController::class);
```

This single route declaration creates multiple routes to handle all CRUD operations. To view list of available routes use (add | grep <route-name> to filter):

```bash
php artisan route:list
```

## Relationships

Relationships are defined as methods on your Eloquent model classes. Since relationships also serve as powerful [query builders](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queries), defining relationships as methods provides powerful method chaining and querying capabilities. Once the relationship is defined, we may retrieve the related record using Eloquent's dynamic properties. Dynamic properties allow you to access relationship methods as if they were properties defined on the model:

```php
$phone = User::find(1)->phone;
```

Foreign key of the relationship is determined based on the parent model name. Eloquent assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the primary key column of the parent. In other words, Eloquent will look for the value of the user's **id**(primary key) column in the **user_id(foreign key column in phone table) column of the Phone record.


[Read more about Relationships ->](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent-relationships#introduction)

## Rendering pages and Routing

### Using Inertia library

In Controllers render method return a component like so:

```php
use Inertia\Inertia;

// inside class:

public function index()
{
  return Inertia::render('PageName/Index', [
    'propName' -> $propValue,
    'secondPropName' -> $secondPropValue,
  ])
}
```

Where PageName and Index (case sensitive) is a a directory and file name that translates to: **resources/js/Pages/PageName/Index.vue**. In page component don't forget to receive props:

```ts
import { Head, Link } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3';

defineProps({
  propName: PropType,
  secondPropName: SecondPropType,
})
```

As you can see by the first line of example above, Inertia has some custom and ready to use components.

[Read more about Inertia ->](https://inertiajs.com)

If a route is simple we don't have to create controller for it. We can call Inertia directly when fetching route:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Welcome');
})
```

Note that it is still considered best practice to handle rendering of any route in a dedicated controller class.

### Naming routes

You can always name a route which can be helpful if one controller handles multiple nested routes:

```php
Route::get('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'edit'])->name('profile.edit');
```

Then, in any method of any controller we can use name of the route in a function like so:

```php
 return Redirect::route('profile.edit');
```

### Route model binding

When injecting a model ID to a route or controller action, you often would have query the database to retrieve the model that corresponds to that ID in order to extract relevant data that you might want to render or work with. Laravel route model binding provides a convenient way to automatically inject the model instances directly into your routes.

```php
use App\Models\Model;

Route::get('/models/{model}', function (Model $model) {
    return Inertia:render('SomeModels/SampleModel', [
      'importantProp' -> $model->someRelevantAttribute
    ]);
});
```

In the example above we hint to Laravel that argument is of **Model** type and is named **$model** which also corresponds to variable part of the route( **{model}**). Thanks to this Laravel will retrieve and pass a whole model class instead of the id when querying this route. Implicit binding is also possible when using controller methods.

## Authentication

## Authorization

### Gates

Gates are simply functions that determine if a user is authorized to perform a given action. Typically, gates are defined within the boot method of the **App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider** class using the Gate facade.Using them we can check if action is allowed by calling **Gate::allows('rule-name', $args)** (or **Gate::denies**) in our route closure - if condition won't pass we can call **abort(403)**.

```php
Gate::define('update-post', function (User $user, Post $post) {
  return $user->id === $post->user_id;
});
```

Then in controller:

```php
if (! Gate::allows('update-post', $post)) {
  abort(403);
}
```

Even better practice is to use:

```php
Gate::authorize('update-post', $args);
```

This will throw if condition is not passed and Laravel will catch it and return 403 automatically. Gates always receive a user instance as their first argument and may optionally receive additional arguments (**$args** in example above) - a relevant model for example.

[Read more about Gates ->](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authorization#gates)

## Policies

Policies are classes that organize authorization logic around a particular model or resource.

To create an empty Policy we can use artisan:

```bash
artisan make:policy <model_name_policy> --model=<model_name>
```

*If you would like to generate a class with example policy methods related to viewing, creating, updating, and deleting the resource, you may provide a --model option when executing the command*

TODO:
Using policies in gates

Returning custom responses from a policy is done using **Illuminate\Auth\Access\Response** class using allow or deny method.

You can also register policies manually if you want:

```php
protected $policies = [
  Post::class => EditableResourcePolicy::class,
];

```

### Nested resource creation:

When creating a new entry in the database that has nested models, it is important to validate the input data, create the nested models, and associate them with the main model in a structured and maintainable way.

In Laravel, one way to approach this is to use Form Request classes for the main model and the nested models validation. The main model's Form Request class should handle the validation of the main model's data and the nested models' data. This can be done by creating new instances of the nested models' Form Request classes within the main model's Form Request class and passing in the relevant data from the original request.

Additionally, you can use Resource Controllers for the main model and the nested models, where the main model's Resource Controller should handle the creation of the main model and the nested models. This can be done by extracting the logic for creating and validating the nested models into separate methods and calling them from the main model's store method. Example below shows this approach, where the CourseController class handles the creation of the main model and the nested models(Menu).

```php
public function store(CourseRequest $request)
{
    ...

    // Create Menus:
    $this->createMenus($request, $course);

    ...
}

...

protected function createMenus(CourseRequest $request, Course $course)
{
    if (empty($request->menus)) {
        return;
    }

    $createdMenus = [];
    foreach ($request->menus as $menu) {
        $createdMenus[] = $this->createMenu($menu, $course);
    }

    $course->menus()->saveMany($createdMenus);
}

protected function createMenu($menu, Course $course)
{
    $newMenu = new Menu();
    $newMenu->fill($menu);
    $newMenu->course()->associate($course);
    $newMenu->save();

    return $newMenu;
}
```

## Nova:

To visit nova's dashboard after installing it go to:

```
project_link/nova/login
```
You can remove nova prefix in config if you wish to. To login you need to create a user first:

```bash
php artisan nova:user
```

Like with all DB queries this should be run either making sure you have connection to db or via sail cli.

To create new resource:

```bash
php artisan nova:resource <resource_name>
```

Main display method for any Resource is id but we can customize it like so:

```php
public static $title = 'name';
```

Before working with any resource in Laravel Nova, it is important to make sure that you allow mass assignment(either by **$fillable** or **$guarded** property usage) on all fields that the form will be using by specifying them as fillable in the laravel model associated with resource.

If some of your Laravel Models have relationships to one another then we need to let Nova know about them as well. We can do it by using for example **BelongsTo::make()** field type and pass method name from the model as parameter.

[Read more about relationships in Nova ->](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/resources/relationships.html#relationships)

**fields** function needs to return an array of columns we want to be visible and at the same time it will influence what form inputs we have when we create/edit resource.

```php
Text::make('Name', 'name')
```

Some of most popular field types:

**Text**
**Markdown**
**Currency**
**Number**
**Boolean**

We use make method to specify label and db column to be used (**Text::make('User email', 'public_email')**)
and can chain the **->required()** method to add basic validation. For more advanced validation it's best to use rules defined for model in it's corresponding request class by chaining **rules** method (also check **creationRules** and **updateRules**).

Using **from** combined with **withMeta** can add auto generated field content to some fields which will be customizable in edit mode but disabled by default:

```php
Slug::make('Slug')
  ->from('name')
  ->withMeta([
    'readonly' => true
  ])
```

We can show/hide certain fields in specific views by chaining appropriate method like **hideFromIndex** / **showOnIndex**.

[Read more about displaying fields](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/resources/fields.html#showing-hiding-fields)

Adding placeholders is also very easy - all we need to do is to chain **placeholder** method and pass a placeholder text to it. Similarly we can change alignment of test with **textAlign** and add a helper text under input with **help**. We can also make field sortable in index view by chaining **sortable** method.

We can also add fields on which search should be performed by adding column names in **search** property.

```php
public static $search = [ 'uuid', 'name', 'description' ];
```

To adjust spacing between rows we can change **$tableStyle** property to 'tight'.

```php
public static $tableStyle = 'tight';
```

For even more visual clarity in index view we can overwrite **showColumnBorders** default value to true.

```php
public static $showColumnBorders = true;
```

We can adjust on click action for products displayed in table by overwriting **clickAction** property. We can change values to: **default**, **edit**, **ignore**, **preview**, **select**.

Nova also uses [Laravel Policies](#policies) and we can define what actions(buttons) and resources are available for any given user type.

We can add subtitles in global search by overwriting a subtitle method on a resource (it should return a string). We can also configure properties like **$globalSearchResults** (number of shown results) and debounce time(configurable in NovaServiceProvider's **boot** method). We can also disable resource from global search by setting **$globallySearchable** to false.

To create new filter we can use:

```bash
php artisan nova:filter <filter_name>
```

A new filter will appear in **Nova/Filters** directory. To use that filter in a resource we need to return it inside array from a **filters** method. Defining options and returning query is handled inside new filter class in **options** and **apply** methods respectively.

Metrics allow you to quickly gain insight on key business indicators for your application. For example, you may define a metric to display the total number of users added to your application per day, or the amount of weekly sales for a given product. Nova offers several types of built-in metrics: value, trend, partition, and progress.

To define new metric use:

```bash
php artisan nova:<metric_type> <metric_name>
```

Then, besides configuring your metric class you need to return it in **cards** method of your resource.

[Read more about metrics ->](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/metrics/defining-metrics.html#defining-metrics)

We can customize side menu in Nova by calling **Nova::mainMenu** method in NovaServiceProvider's **boot** method.

[Read more about customizing menu ->](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/customization/menus.html)

In many places in Nova we can use icons. Nova utilizes free part of [Heroicons](https://github.com/sschoger/heroicons-ui).
